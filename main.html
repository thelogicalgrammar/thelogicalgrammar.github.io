        I am a Sardinian researcher at the
	  <a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-humanities/departments/modern-languages/department-of-linguistics/">
        University of Tübingen</a>, where I am doing a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship
	  with <a href="https://michael-franke.github.io/heimseite/">Michael Franke</a>. 
	  In this project, I apply various methods, both computational and experimental, to further our understanding of plausible deniability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before this, I did a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl">Institute for Language, Logic, and Computation</a> in Amsterdam
		with <a href="https://jakubszymanik.com">Jakub Szymanik</a>, as part of the Cognitive Semantics and Quantities project. 
		In my postdoc at the ILLC, I looked at the semantics and pragmatics of quantifiers from a Bayesian and evolutionary perspective.

        I finished my PhD in the
        <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/">Centre for Language Evolution</a> at the University of Edinburgh in 2020.
        I was supervised by <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~simon/">Simon Kirby</a> and
        <a href="https://mariekeschouwstra.github.io/">Marieke Schouwstra</a>.
	
        In my PhD, I studied the evolutionary mechanisms that lead to the emergence of cross-linguistically stable
        properties in the semantics of scalar language, including gradable adjectives, quantifiers, and modals.
        In particular, I looked at two universals of scalar semantics, monotonicity and extremeness.
